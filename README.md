Shelby Quickstart Guide
---
Simple samples to start serving with Shelby

## üìã System Requirements
* Node v22 or later
* Linux or MacOS

## üì¶ Installation
**NOTE:** This repo requires the CLI for both [Shelby](https://docs.shelby.xyz/tools/cli) and [Aptos](https://aptos.dev/build/cli). Install these first if you haven't already.
1. Fork this repository
1. Clone to local filesystem
1. Run `npm install` or equivalent
1. Run `npm run build` or equivalent

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup
Before working with the code in this repo, ensure that you've completed all of the steps in the [Shelby CLI Getting Started](https://docs.shelby.xyz/tools/cli) guide. This will give you access to the `shelby` command and simplify the steps described below.

## üíª Usage

The purpose of this repository is to introduce you to core Shelby concepts in an interactive way. After you have tried out all of the steps, you will have a basic understanding of how Shelby works. Please take a look at the code. Modify it as you see fit. Treat this repo as the starting point for your own Shelby integration. **Once you have created something, please share it with us in Discord. We would love to see what you are building!**

Example interactions included in this guide:

### 1. Development Account Config

`npm run config`

**Executes code from `src/guide/config.ts`**

_Launch an interactive CLI that creates the configuration you want to use for integrating with Shelby._

After running this command, you may notice the `.env` file we have generated. Next, fund your development address using the [ShelbyUSD faucet](https://docs.shelby.xyz/apis/faucet/shelbyusd) and [Aptos faucet](https://docs.shelby.xyz/apis/faucet/aptos) for Shelbynet: sign in, paste your address, and click the `Fund` button.

This `.env` file contains all of the config options needed to use Shelby:
1. Account address ‚Äî _The Aptos account that will pay for storage_
1. Account private key ‚Äî _The private key used to sign transactions_
1. Aptos network name ‚Äî _For now this will always be "devnet"_
1. Shelby RPC node ‚Äî _The host that your app uses for Shelby operations_

__REMINDER:__ _Do not use real private keys (or recovery phrases) for development. Use proper secret management in production._

### 2. Upload Blobs to Shelby

`npm run upload`

**Executes code from `src/guide/upload.ts`**

_Launch an interactive CLI that asks you to select a file for upload as the specified blob name. Sample assets have been provided for your convenience._

After running this command, you will see output describing the data that you've just uploaded. Important concepts to note:
1. Merkle root ‚Äî _This hash can be used to later verify the integrity of uploaded data._
1. Chunkset commitments ‚Äî _How your data is encoded and stored durably on Shelby's decentralized network._

For more information about these and other important concepts, please read the [Shelby whitepaper](https://shelby.xyz/whitepaper.pdf) ‚Äî included in this repo under the `assets/` directory!

### 3. List the Blobs on Shelby

`npm run list`

_Launch an interactive CLI that asks which account's blobs you'd like to list._

After running this command, you will see output describing the blobs that are currently stored on Shelby for the specified account. Remember: you provide the storage duration at time of upload, so you will not see blobs that have expired.

### 4. Download a Blob from Shelby

`npm run download`

**Executes code from `src/guide/download.ts`**

_Launch an interactive CLI that allows you to provide a blob name and destination for download to local filesystem._

## Development
After completing the steps above, you now know everything necessary to start building your own integration with Shelby! Head over to `src/index.ts` for a simple stub that gives the Shelby whitepaper a round-trip ride as a blob. It utilizes the same `.env` file we created earlier for ease of getting started.

### Watch for Changes
To watch for changes as you build, use `npm run dev`. This will start a long-running process that automatically re-compiles everything in `src/`
